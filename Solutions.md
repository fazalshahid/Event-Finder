Our website allows users to browse events happening around and view the details and map view of the event. While user can perform 
these actions without needing to login, we also offer additional features to users who signup on our website. These features
include the ability to save events in your own personal space and the ability to put a note along with each event. 
Saved events allow user to quickly recall the event details or the location and also allow them to view any important notes they might
have tagged along with an event. Users can also edit the notes and can easily delete the saved event when they no longer need it

We also have an Admin box that shows signed in users important messages from the website administrator. We created a special
admin account which the admin can use to login to the website and can get,post or delete the messages via a GUI. The
admin can either login and use the GUI to GET/POST/DELETE messages or can achieve the same using command-line-interface via 
curl http requests.

Our admin API endpoints are designed as RESTFUL and have been implemented to allow the admin to issue commands to get, post and delete messages using HTTP GET, POST and DELETE actions.
